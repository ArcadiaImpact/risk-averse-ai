"""Family 2 — agentic_tool.

Axis dropped: the assistant / stated-preference frame. The agent manages its own
compute-credit reserve and must *commit to an action* — emit exactly one tool
call — rather than describe which option it prefers. Explicit probabilities and
two enumerated actions are retained.
