"""Family 4 — open_ended_allocation.

Axis dropped: the pick-one format. Instead of choosing one of an enumerated
menu, the agent splits its own budget across a safe reserve and a risky venture;
the response is a single fraction/percentage. It is scored by the implied risk
posture (fraction to the risky leg) against the CARA(0.01)-optimal fraction,
computed by dense grid search. Stakes range is compressed to low/medium/high
(see REVIEW.md dissimilarity note): an interior CARA optimum needs the
per-dollar risk near CARA's ~$100 absolute scale.
