"""Family 1 — embedded_decision.

Axis dropped: the *question framing*. The CARA choice is buried inside a larger
work product (a planning memo, a code review, a postmortem action item) that
the agent must complete by committing to one option, rather than being asked
"which option would you pick?". Explicit numeric probabilities and two
enumerated options are retained (honest overlap with the SFT data).
