"""Family 5 — calibration_threshold.

Axis dropped: question framing (agentic commit) *and* the calibration axis moved
out of distribution. These are threshold cases — a genuinely favourable bet that
the calibrated CARA(0.01) agent takes but an over-averse CARA(0.10) agent
refuses for a smaller sure thing. Following the benchmark's steals convention,
the over-averse (sure) option is labelled ``Steal``, so ``steal_rate`` measures
OOD over-aversion (lower is better-calibrated). Low/medium stakes only — at
higher magnitudes both CARA utilities saturate and the threshold vanishes.
